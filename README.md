# GWAS
Genome wide association studies  is a population statistics methods to identify the genomic region involved in target trait based on association analysis between the phenotypic variation and genome-wide SNPs in addition with higher resolution as compared to the biparental populations.
# Requirement
# Environment
R version4.1.1--https://cran.r-projects.org./

# IDE
Rstudio Desktop version 2022.07.2--https://posit.co/products/opensource/rstudio/

# Package

rMVP version 1.0.0--https://github.com/xiaolei-lab/rMVP

# Data
the haplotype map file geno.hmp.txt  and Pheno.txt was used in this project.

# GAPPIT
GAPIT is a Genome Association and Prediction Integrated Tool freely available for Public since 2011. GAPIT implemented a series of methods for Genome Wide Association (GWAS) and Genomic Selection(GS).
FarmCPU “Fixed and random model Circulating Probability Unification” join the advantages of mixed linear model and stepwise regression (fixed effect model) and overcome their disadvantages by using them iteratively.
# Usage
working directory GAPPIT needs to be created also geno.hmp.txt and pheno.txt need to be copied before running this script

# Installation

# things to remember before starting
 Now we need to import the data files that we will be using for doing the analysis. Best to have
 data saved in a text format. If you are using R studio you can import the files using the import 
 wizard located under the tools tab at the top.This may be the easiest as it walks you through the 
 process. You may perfer the command line method as it gives you more controll over the import of the 
 data. Using the following command, file.choose(), opens a browser allowing you to select the name of 
the file in the approriate directory. Select the file and the name of the file will appear in the
 consol window. Copy and paste this name into the read.table command.
If your data is in the HapMap format, you will only need the two files-the phenotypic and the hapmap
file. We will do this analysis first for the sake of time. 

hapmap_geno<-read.table("geno.hmp.txt", head=F) # make sure header=F
pheno<-read.table("pheno.txt",head=TRUE)

#myCV <- read.table("Q3_ADMIX.txt", head=TRUE) ## K = 3 provided a good assessment of population structure.

good idea to check our pehontype data to make sure the file strucutre is correct and how the data
 is distributed, checking for outliers

str(pheno) # gives us information on the object, in this case a data frame and other information
hist(pheno$protein) # creates a histogram plot of our data, things look pretty good, we have a
 #lines that are bit extreme but with 775 lines we would expect about 27 to be at least 3 sd's away from
 # the mean. 

#some basic statistics to look at 
mean(pheno$protein) # 12.23
range(pheno$protein) # 9.5 to 15.8
sd(pheno$protein) # .88
which(is.na(pheno$protein)) # look for lines with missing data, there should be none which is confimred
  # by the result in the console "integer(0) meaning the number of NA values was 0

# the following is a very basic analysis. Make sure to change directory to where the results
# will be saved. In R studio go to session at the top and select "set working directory"
# and select "choose directory"- this will allow you to browse to the correct folder in which you
# would like to save the results. Once you locate the correct folder, highlight it and hit select.

# or you can do it manually using the something like the following
dir.create("No-compression")

setwd("F://Data/GAPIT/No-compression/")

# first analysis where compression is not used in the model, this is done by setting the group.from 
# and group.to equal to the size of your population and then setting the group.by to 1 so that each 
# entry is consider its own "group." Again, refer to manual for complete description.

  SNP.impute="Major",
  PCA.total=3,

  group.from=768,
  group.to=768,
  group.by=1)


# now we use compression to see how that effects the outcome of the analysis. The default settings 
# for compression are to group by 10. You can change this to whatever value you feel like. It is
# important to note that not all values will work depending on your population. You will get the error
# that "matrix is singular, select another level." You can keep selecting levels until you find one 
# that works. However, compression may not make that big of a difference for your analyses. To read
# more about it see "Mixed linear model approach for genome-wide association studies" Zhang et al. 
# Nature Genetics 2010

# if you want to use the default settings for compression, you do not need to specify anything.

  kinship.cluster=c("complete","ward"),
  kinship.group=c("Mean","Max","Median"),
  PCA.total=3,

  Model.selection=T)

# this analysis used different kinship clustering methods to group individuals based on their kinship.
# For kinship.group in used three different methods to derive kinship among the groups. The final line
# of code implements the model selection feature of GAPIT. This feature uses the Bayesian information
# criteria (BIC) to select the optimal number of principal components to use in the model. This is done
# because the degree of population structure can vary form trait to trait, therefore you don't always need
# to use the same number of principal components for each trait. 

# Below is the output from this analysis, note the difference in FDR p-values. The optimal model
# did not use any PCs, the best method for deriving kinship between groups was "Max", and the 
# kinship clustering method that was used was "Complete". The number of groups did not change, neither
# did the estimate of heritability.

# 12_11437	9.17E-06
# 12_30301	0.000428139

# the FDR p-values that we got were a bit smaller than our analysis using compression with the 
# default settings. This example illustrates the value of trying a few analyses.
